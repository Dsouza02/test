Dictionary is GENERIC while HashTable is not generic : Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, There is a tiny difference between them that if dictionary can not find specific key will throw an exception while HashTable just returns null.

Use generic types to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance.
he most common use of generics is to create collection classes.
the T is a placeholder for an arbitrary type; it means that SampleCollection can represent a collection of objects, the type of which you specify when you create the collection.
