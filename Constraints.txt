Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.



NOT NULL Constraint - Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.

DEFAULT Constraint - Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

UNIQUE Constraint - Ensures that all values in a column are different.

PRIMARY Key - Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

FOREIGN Key - Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database table.

CHECK Constraint - The CHECK constraint ensures that all the values in a column satisfies certain conditions.

INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.
